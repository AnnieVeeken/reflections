When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?
when you are somewhere else, using another computer, or when another 
person wants to add sometihing to the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You only want to pull when you are ready for new files, not when you 
are working on it.
