When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?
when you are somewhere else, using another computer, or when another 
person wants to add sometihing to the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You only want to pull when you are ready for new files, not when you 
are working on it.

git remote
shows which remote branches you have.

git remote -v
shows more details

git remote add origin https://github.com/AnnieVeeken/reflections.git
adds remote branch called origin on https... to local repository

git push origin master
pushes local branch master to remote repostory origin

git pull origin master
pulls the branch master from remote repostory origin

Fork on GitHub makes a clone on GitHub. Use git clone https... to 
add it to your working repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of another?
Fork is a clone of a repository on github.
Clone is a copy of a repository on working directory.
Branch is a name for a series of commits.

git pull origin/master == git fetch origin + git merge master origin/master

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally?
Changes other people make are commits on that state. Later your own 
changes can be merged from that point.
