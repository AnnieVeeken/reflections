git init: Command to make a new repository
git status: command to get information about repository

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A file named .git is made in the curent direcory. There are no files yet
 in the repository, you have to make the first commmit yourself.

In git there is staging area to which you add all files youo want to 
put in one commit. 

git add: adds files to the staging area

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area keeps all the files you want to keep together in one 
commit. In the working directory are all files.

git diff compares working directory with staging area.
git diff --staged compares staging area with latest commit in repository
git diff commit1 commit2 compares commit1 with commit2

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?
You can add all files you need to staging area.
