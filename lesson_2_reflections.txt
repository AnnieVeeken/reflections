A file named .git is made in the curent direcory. There are no files yet
 in the repository, you have to make the first commmit yourself.

In git there is staging area to which you add all files youo want to 
put in one commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area keeps all the files you want to keep together in one 
commit. In the working directory are all files.
